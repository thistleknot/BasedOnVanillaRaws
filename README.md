Accelerated Modest Mod for 40_08

using tortoisegitmerge

Contains improvements for:

	Based on: MEPH'S ACCELERATED MODEST MOD.

FPS simplified ui/improvment:

	by removing:
	
		Extra Stones (soil layer)
		
		Leather types (Billy Jack's)
		
		Simplified creature material's
		
		Wood types
		
		Toy Types

I took the liberty of removing:
